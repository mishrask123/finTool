## PM DECISIONS

| Date | Symbol | Decision | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-07 | ETSY | **PASS** | PM call. Was the best-supported name in the filtered cut (R:R 4.0, DVOL $226M, beta 1.17, grounded 09-04). Passed anyway. |

## OPEN — put to PM, not yet decided

| Symbol | State |
|---|---|
| BFLY | HALF discussed. Sizing OK'd as a class; stop width unresolved — file stop 4.2% (7.05) is unusable at beta 3.41, use ~15% floor (~6.26). No PM decision yet. |
| STX | Held 7 sh (~$5,945, avg 819, +3.7%), 2.4x standard size, NO STOP in place. Add / floor question open. |

## Standing data-integrity items

- **BAND / CRDO / ASAN** — `stop_loss_px` above Friday's close; fire instantly if placed as written.
- **BFLY** — same class of problem, not yet inverted: 4.2% stop at beta 3.41.
- `pnl/20260904.tsv` is a **14:32 ET intraday snapshot**, not the close; its PnL understates.
- `limit_px` is the 20d TARGET, not an entry limit (identical to `pred_target_px_20d`, 111/111).
